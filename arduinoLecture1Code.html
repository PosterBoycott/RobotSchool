            <p><b>Objective: Turn on an LED.   </b></p>
            <p>Now let us look at the file. The first thing we will see is that there are already things 
                written in it. It is two parts. The <b>setup()</b> part and the <b>loop()</b> part.</p>
            <img src="arduinoTemplate.jpg" alt="arduinoTemplate">
            <p>
                The <b>setup()</b> part is the code that is executed first. This code, as the name
                 suggests sets everything up for the <b>loop()</b> part. The code in this part is 
                 executed once and never executed again. The code gets executed from the top to the bottom
                 , one instruction at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the <b>setup()</b> is complete we go into the <b>loop()</b> part. The loop part runs
                 until either itâ€™s power is turned off we made it turn off in the code. The code gets 
                 executed from the top to the bottom, one instruction at a time.
            </p>
            <h3>Let's Start Coding</h3>
            <p>Choose the pin we are going to use and tell the computer whether we want to use this pin 
                as an input or as an output. We will use pin 3 and use it as an output. Spelling is important.
                Do not forget the <b>Semicolon</b>.
            </p>
            <img src="pinMode.jpg" alt="pinMode">
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Let us make the output of this PIN high. We can understand what the next line of code is 
                doing by making the Arduino board a metaphorical battery, where the positive side of the 
                battery is at the pin number we have selected (in this case 3) and the negative side of 
                the battery is at the ground pin. When the pin is high the battery is charged, when the 
                pin low the battery is flat.
            </p>
            <p>Specify the pin number and then say wheter the output should be high or low.</p>

                The code that is behind // in the code example are called comments and are not seen by the
                 computer. It is there so that both you and other people can add notes in the code file so
                  that everyone knows what the code is doing.
