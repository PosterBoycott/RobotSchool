        <h1>Charge</h1>
        <p>Before going into the details of what exactly is and causes charge, we will first look 
            at an example of charge.</p>
        <p>After rubbing the balloon to your or your friend's hair, you can see that the hair rises 
            and follows the direction that you are moving the balloon. In order to move an object 
            like your pen or your book, something or someone should push, pull or apply a force on 
            it. The same applies to your hair. It does not move on its own, it needs a force like 
            wind or a hand or in this case electric force that is caused by your hair and the 
            balloon being electricly charged.</p>
        
        <p>You might be wondering what causes the balloon and the hair to be electricly charged. 
            It obviously has something to do with the rubbing of the hair and balloon, but what truely 
            causes this?</p>
        
        <p>To understand this, we first have to look at the Bohr diagram of an atom. As you can see in 
            figure 1, the atom consists of a nucleus and a couple of electron shells. The nucleus has 
            two building blocks, the protons (which is positively charged) and the neutrons (which has 
            no charge). The electron shells consist only of electrons which are negatively charged. A 
            atom as you would find on the periodic table are neutral. This means that and atom will have 
            the the same number of protons as electrons. An atom can become polarized (not neutral, 
            either positive or negatively charged) when the atom is provided with sufficient amount 
            of energy. This energy will cause an atom to either gain or lose an electron. It can never
             lose a proton!!</p>
            
        <p>We say that a atom is positively charged when it lost an electron and we say an atom is 
            negatively charged when it gained an electron. Atoms tend to be as neutral as possible. 
            What does this have to do with the balloon example?</p>
        
        <p>In the balloon example you were rubbing your har to the balloon, this caused some electron
             from your hair to rub of onto the balloon. This made your hair positevly charged and the
              balloon negatively charged. Now the question you might ask your self is, why does this
               cause the hair to follow the balloon? Do you remember "Atoms tend to be as neutral
                as possible". The balloon and your hair are now trying to get closer together so that
                 they can transfer the same amount of electrons back so that they can be neutral again.
                  This causes a force to exist between the two of them which makes them attract 
                  eachother.</p>
        <p>There are 3 types charges:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Neutral</li>
            <li>Negative</li>
            <li>Positive</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We already know what causes them to exist. How do they react to eachother?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Negatively charged object and Positively charged object will attract eachother.</li>
            <li>Two Negatively charged objects will repel eachother.</li>
            <li>Two Neutrally charged objects will have no effect on eachother.</li>
            <li>Two Positively charged objects will repel eachother.</li>
            <li>A Negatively charged object and a Neutrally charged object will attract eachother.</li>
            <li>A Positively charged object and a Neutrally charged object will attract eachother.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So we now have a good idea of what charge is. The unit we use for charge is coulomb (C). You 
            have three. Three of what, apples, cars? Coulomb is used to specify what the number represents.
             When giving an answer always give a unit.</p>
        
        <p>A single electron has a charge of -1.602 x 10-19 C. It is negative, which is expected considering 
            that electrons are negative and protons are positive.</p>
        
        <h1>Current</h1>
        <p>We know know what charge is. We know that charge can be tranfered from one object to another 
            if sufficient energy are provided for electrons to move. The more electrons moves the more 
            charge will move from one object to a another. Considering that this electrical charge can
             be responsible for "creating" a force between objetcs. It would be useful to know how much
              charge will be tranfered from one point to another point in a period of time (profided 
              it has sufficient energy to leave the neutral atom).</p>
        
        <p>This change of current in a small period of time is given its own name. This is called current 
            and has the unitAmpere or Amps (A). The formula for calculating current if the charge transferred
             and time change is given is given in the eqaution below.</p>
        
        <p><b>I = Q/t (A)</b></p>

        <p><b>I</b> is current measured in amps <b>A</b>.</p>

        <p><b>Q</b> is charge measured in coulomb <b>C</b></p>

        <p><b>t</b> is the change in time measured in seconds <b>s</b></p>

        <p>In electronics current flows through a wire from one end of a power source (like a battery)
             to the other end of the source in a loop. An easy way to visualize current is by using water
              flowing through a water pipe as an analogy. Current flows through the wire like water 
              flows in a pipe. Where the water droplets will be the electrons flowing. Please do 
              remember that current is the flow of charge. Every electron has a small amount of charge.
               Current is not the flow of electrons but rather the amount of charge carried by an 
               electron from one end of the wire (pipe) to the other.</p>

        <h1>Voltage</h1>

        <p>What causes current to flow? Before we talked about how we needed a force for electrons to 
            be tranfered from one object to another object or in this case from one part of the wire 
            to a different part of the wire. As you can see from the heading... That would be Voltage.</p>

        <p>Voltage is the potentiol difference beween to points of a wire. Let us take a look a the water 
            analogy again. Current is flowing through the pipe. This means that there is already water 
            in the pipe. What happens when you lift one end of the pipe up so that it is higher than 
            the other? Well water will flow from the higher point to the lower point. The higher you 
            lift the one end the faster the water will flow. If you lift both the same amount... 
            It will not change the rate at which the water is flowing. Thus we can say that the height 
            the two are does not matter, but the difference in height between the two of them is what 
            causes water to flow faster. Voltage is the "height" of the circuit from one point relative 
            to another point.</p>

        <h1>Resistance</h1>

        <p>Resistance is a measurement of how difficult it is for current to flow trough a wire from one 
            point to another point. Let us look at the following alanalogy for resistance. Imagine you 
            have a plastic bottle full of water. You now take a needle and make a small hole in the 
            bottle. You can imagine that water will not be flowing out particularly quickly. Now take 
            a pair of scissors and make the whole bigger. You will notice that water starts flowing 
            quicker now. The smaller hole has a higher tendancy to resist current flow than the bigger 
            whole. Coming back to Resistance. In electricity flow, resistance is the tendancy to resist 
            current flow. The higher the resistance, the harder it would be for current to flow.</p>

        <h1>Capasitance</h1>

        <p>Capasitance is the ability of a system to store an electric charge. In electronics there is 
            a component (capasitor) that stores electric charge in two parallel plates. We are not going 
            into this in depth now, but just know that certain capasitors store charge better than others.</p>

        <h1>Inductance</h1>

        <p>Inductance refers to the abality of a system to store electric charge in a magnetic field. 
            In electronics there is a component (inductor) that stores charge in a magnetic field. We 
            are not going into this in depth now, but just know that certain inductors store charge 
            better than others.</p>
