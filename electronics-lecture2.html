        <h1>Ohm's Law</h1>
        <p>Ohm's law is a formula that gives the relationship between current, voltage and resistance 
            mathematically.</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <p>V=IR</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>V = Voltage measured in V (volts)</li>
            <li>I = Current measured in A (ampere)</li>
            <li>R = Resistance measured in Ω (ohm)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>Calculate the resistance of the light bulb given that the current flowing through the light bulb 
            is 1A and the voltage across the light bilb is 1.5V.</p>
        
        <p>In the circuit above. There are three components in the circuit. The first is the battery. The 
            battery has a constant voltage, meaning (it's one terminal has more potential then the other).
             Refer back to height analogy. This give the power to the circuit.</p>
            
        <p>The second is the switch. The button that you would click to turn your light on and on.</p>

        <p>The third is the light bulb.</p>

        <p>To calculate the Resistance of the light bulb we do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write down the standard eqaution.</li>
            <li>Manipulate the eqaution to solve for the unknown.</li>
            <li>Substitute the known variables with the given values.</li>
            <li>Write down answer with the unit.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Step 1: V = IR</p>
        <p>Step 2: R= V/I</p>
        <p>Step 3: R= 1.5/1</p>
        <p>Step 4: R= 1.5 Ω</p>
        <h1>Series and Parallel</h1>
        <p>In the previous example, we only had one light bulb but what happens when we have more than one. 
            There are two ways that you can connect the light bulbs. The first is a head to tail connection 
            which is called a series connection and the second is a head-head, tail-tail connection. This 
            connection is called a parallel connection.</p>
        <h2>Series Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Current through every point is the same.</li>
            <li>Resistance of the circuit is the sum of all the resistor values.</li>
            <li>The voltage of the componets can differ.</li>
            <li>The sum of the voltages of each resistor will eqaul the voltage of the battery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>R<sub>T</sub>=R<sub>1</sub>+R<sub>2</sub>+...+R<sub>n</sub></p>
        <p>V<sub>T</sub>=V<sub>1</sub>+V<sub>2</sub>+...+V<sub>>n</sub></p>
        <p>I<sub>T</sub>=I<sub>1</sub>=I<sub>2</sub>=...=I<sub>n</sub></p>
        <h2>Parallel Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Voltage across every component is the same.</li>
            <li>The resiprocal of the total resistance is eqaul to the reciprocal sum of all the components.</li>
            <li>The current flowing through each component can differ.</li>
            <li>The sum of all the currents flowing through each branch will eqaul the battery current.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>1/R<sub>T</sub>=1/R<sub>1</sub>+1/R<sub>2</sub>+...+1/R<sub>n</sub></p>
        <p>V<sub>T</sub>=V<sub>1</sub>=V<sub>2</sub>=...=V<sub>n</sub></p>
        <p>I<sub>T</sub>=I<sub>1</sub>+I<sub>2</sub>+...+I<sub>n</sub></p>

        <p>Often times circuit variables can not be solved by just using Ohm's law.</p>
        <p>Often times circuit variables can not be solved by just using Ohm's law.</p>
        <h1>Kirchhoff's Current Law</h1>
        <p>Kirchoff's current law is the counter part of Kirchhoff's voltage law. As the name suggests 
            this law is applicable to all currents in a circuit.</p>
