        <h1>Financial Model</h1>
        <h2>Lecturers</h2>
        <p>At the University of Cape tutors get paid between a R109 (for undergraduate students) and R193 
            (PhD graduate) a/hour at the time that I am reading this.</p>
        <p>https://hr.uct.ac.za/remuneration-benefits-remuneration/rates-tutors-demonstrators-teaching-
            assistants-and-guest-lecturersteachers-2023</p>
        <p>Our goal with regards to lecturer payment is to be somewhere in the middle of this. R 150/hour
             would be a good target.</p>
        <p>One of the problems with tutoring is that there is hardly any flexibility in terms of when you 
            will be presenting a class.Instead of having anyone tell you when you must present a class, you 
            organize the class times 
            yourself, be reasonable. Learners do not want to be at school until 6.</p>

        <h2>Business Expander</h2>
        <p>The business expander is a lecturer, but in addition to being a lecture also expands our business.
             They would get other schools and or communities to join the school system. We strongly encourage
              you to be a business expander. The bonus could be a % revenue or a once of cash bonus. Saying 
              exactly what the reward will be is hard to say, because it
               will depend on the situation. For example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>How many learners did Business Expander get to join?</li>
            <li>How long will this community join for?</li>
            <li>Is the school in a high theft area?</li>
            <li>The list goes on.</li>
        </ol>
