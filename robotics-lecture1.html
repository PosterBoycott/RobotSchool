        <h1>Arduino Uno</h1>
        <p>The Arduino Uno is in simple terms the brain of our car. It takes commands from us and stores 
            it in it's memory so that it can then continously continuously do these commands.</p>

        <p>The commands you will give the Arduino will allow the Arduino to vary the speed at which it 
            will be moving and to change the direction it is moving in.</p>
        
        <p>Before we can do that... You should first know some important parts of the Arduino.</p>

        <h2>Pins</h2>

        <p>If you look at the long sides near the edge of the Arduino, you will see 4 black bars.
             If you look at these bars from the top you will see small sqaure holes. These sqaure
              holes are called Pins. Into these pins you can insert wires that you will use to power
               the motor of the car. These Pins act as a positive side of a battery that will be used 
               along with the Gnd pins, the negative side of the battery. You can control wheter or not the 
               "battery" is on, off or partialy on. More on this later...</p>
        
        <p>Not all these pins are the same. If you look next to the pins on the Arduino uno's "floor" you 
            will see that there are letter and numbers standing there. Every pin has it's own name. At the 
            top pins you will see that they are labeled, in order, from 0 to 13. There is also a Gnd (which 
            you know) and a AREF which you will not care about. These pins (0-13) is refered to as the I/O 
            pins (input/output).</p>

        <p>At the bottom pins on the right you will see pins named from A0 to A5. These are called the 
            Analog pins. I will explain to you what they are use for later on.</p>
        
        <p>The last ones are the power pins. You will see that there is two additional Gnd pins that we 
            can use. The pin Labeled Vin is the pin where the positive side of our battery will be connected 
            to to power the board without it being connected to the computer (Gnd is used for the negative
             side of battery). There is also a 5V and 3V pin. These can get used to power other components.</p>
