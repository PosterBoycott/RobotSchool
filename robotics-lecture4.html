        <h1>Loops</h1>
        <p>Often times when coding you would like to run the same code more than once. You can type
             the same code twice, which will result in the code running twice. This will take too much
              time and effort. Luckily there is a easier way to do this. These are called loops.</p>
        
        <p>There are two types of loops:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Infinite Loop</li>
            <li>Finite Loop</li>
        </ol>
        <p>An infinite loops runs forever without stop.</p>
        <p>An finite loop runs a specified amount of times and then stops.</p>

        <h1>Functions</h1>

        <p>Often when coding reasonably large programs, it gets hard to follow what is happening in the
             main loop, because there are to much code to see. Functions are used to decrease the amount 
             of code that is in the main loop so that it is easier to look at and understand. It is 
             important to know what the difference between the declaration and initialisation of a 
             function is. If you look on your calculator you will see that there is a function called
              sin and cos. Before you are able to use a calculator someone had to tell the calculator
               what it should do when you use it. However in order to use the cos function someone 
               needs to click the button. This means that making a function useable is not the same
                as using a function.</p>
        
        <p>Declaration is when you make the function.</p>

        <p>Initialisation is when you use it.</p>
