        <h1>Variable Declaration</h1>
        <p>A variable is a "keyword" that represents data. For example when x=3; x is a place holder 
            for 3. If I now say Y = X + 1; Y would = 4. In coding storing data in a variable is quite 
            useful because it helps us to remember what is represented by the variable name. There is 
            another advantage, but that will be pointed out later.</p>
        
            <p>An example will make it more clear. There is 4 numbers (4, 3, 5, 2)... I tell you that 
                each of these numbers represents the amount of each type of fruits you have. Apples, 
                bananas, oranges and lemons. At the start of the programing you will know how many of 
                each you have, however... When you have been coding for a while, people tend to forget 
                what the number represent especially when you are doing addition and subtraction which 
                means the number is constantly changing. Meaning that there can at one point be 5 appples
                 and 2 babanas. It is eay to get confused.</p>
            
            <p>Instead of trying to work and remember numbers the whole time. Let us give a name to each 
                variable and use that in calculations.</p>
            
            <p>Every variable has the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Type</li>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Value</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The data type refers to the first "word" of the variable declaration.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>int</li>
                <li>float</li>
                <li>char</li>
                <li>char[]</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The int data type you have already seen. The int stands for integer, a 
                positive or negative number without any decimals.</p>
            
            <p>The float data type represents a number with 0 to 7 decimal places. Do not use float
                 if you do not need decimals!! It takes up more space than integers</p>

            <p>The char data type represents a alphabet character. Only one character.</p>
            
            <p>The char[] is not really a data type. It is the same as char ,but it allows you to use more 
                than one character.</p>
