        <h1>Lecture 1</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings everyone, thank you all for being here today. I am Mr. Thinus and I am thrilled
             to see and meet you all. Today we start with your journey of becoming a critical thinker 
             and an entrepreneur.
        </p>
        <h3>1. What will we be doing today</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Discuss what your project is.</li>
            <li>Discuss what you will learn in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li>You will see what your product of your project will look like.</li>
            <li>Discuss what will you need to do.</li>
            <li>Where can you find information?</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>1.1 What is your project?</h4>
        <p>
            You will need to start your own business. The ultimate goal of this project is to sell the 
            product that you will create. You will need to create a business plan which you would then 
            need to present/pitch to an outside unbiased investor. The investor might ask you a few 
            questions which you will need to answer. After the investor have examined everyone's 
            business proposals, he will approve at most 1/4 of them (the best ones). You cannot afford 
            to be denied. (If asked about what happens to the other 3/4, "There is nothing I can do for 
            you." alternate "You cannot afford to be denied.")
        </p>
        <h4>1.2 What will you learn in the coming weeks?</h4>
        <p>
            You will learn important concepts of electric circuits. We will show you how to do circuit
             analysis, what different components are and what they do, and the fundamental electrical 
             quantities. You will also learn how the Arduino microcontroller works and how to program it.
        </p>
        <h4>1.3 Demonstration of Project</h4>
        <p>
            This object in my hand is a fundamental part of your project/business. You will be designing,
             coding, assembling and ultimately use in your business. It can move forward, reverse and change 
             direction.
        </p>
        <h4>1.4 What you need to do</h4>
        <p>
            The first few weeks are vital if you want to complete this project. You must ensure that you 
            understand exactly what is going on. If you are lost, ask immediately.
        </p>
        <h4>1.5 Information</h4>
        <p>
            If you need additional notes or cannot remember work that was covered in class, you should have 
            noted it down. You can find more information on the website.
        </p>
        <h2>Discussion 1</h2>
        <p>
            In the next couple of sessions, we will be discussing electric circuits. We are going to start 
            from the ground up. Today I want to talk about the different components that we often use in 
            circuits.
