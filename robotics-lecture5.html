        <h1>Pulse Width Modulation</h1>
        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Digital Voltage - Can be completly on or completely off.</li>
            <li>Analog Voltage - Can be completly on, completly off or a value in between.</li>
            <li>Pulse- Is a voltage provided for a given time period.</li>
            <li>Width- A dimension which we refer to as the the lenght of the graphed pulse.</li>
            <li>Modulation- Modifying something.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>PWM</h2>
        <p>What does Pulse Width Modulation do?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changes Digital Voltage to Analog Voltage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why is this useful?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows change in motor rotation speed.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Without this the motor will only be completly off or completly on.</li>
                <li>With this the motor will be able to turn at speeds between max ,completly on, and min, 
                    completly off.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>How does this work?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fluctuate between max voltage and minimum voltage.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Turns the voltage on and off quicker than the eye can see, meaning that we will not 
                    be able to see it flicker.</li>
                <li>Instead we will see the average of the small amount of time it is on and the small 
                    amount of time it is off.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>There are two ways of coding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How to use this on arduino.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The method available for the ~ marked pins.</li>
            <li>The method that can be used for any pin.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>1. The ~ marked pins method</b></p>
        <p>There is a built in function called analogWrite(pin, value). Where the pin is the integer
             number of the pin you want to use and the value is a integer number between 0 and 255.
              The pin has to be marked with a ~ otherwise this will not work. When the value is set
               to 0, the voltage will be zero all the time (voltage delivered = 0). When the value is
                255, the voltage will be on all the time (voltage delivered = Maximum Voltage).</p>
        <p><b>2. 2. Universal Method</b></p>
        <p>This method can be used on any of the Arduino pins. Recall that Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) 
            is basically just a voltage alternating between Vmax and Vmin. Knowing this Arduino allows 
            us to manualy make our own PWM pin by switching the pin on for a few micro seconds and back 
            off for a few micro seconds. Meaning that the ration between the time on and time of will be 
            the voltage delivered. This method have the advantage that we can use any output pin and 
            that there is more control, but there is slightly more mathematics.</p>
