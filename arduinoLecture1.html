                <h2>Arduino Microcontroller Overview</h2>
                <p>Things to see on the micro controller:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</li>
                    <li>I/O pins.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pins with a ~ symbol.</li>
                            <li>Numbers next to them.</li>
                            <li>Pins with an A on them.</li>
                            <li>Pins with a Tx or Rx symbol.</li>
                            <li>Location of the 3V and 5V pin.</li>
                            <li>Location of the Ground pins.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The USB port.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Te microcontroller that we will be working with during our project is the Arduino Uno
                     R3. We will talk about what a microcontroller is, what the different parts of the 
                     microcontroller is and what their functions are. We will also do our first Arduino 
                     Program towards the end of this lecture.
                </p>
                <p>Before I tell you what a microcontroller is I first want to talk about the different 
                    parts of the Microcontroller. It will be a simple overview.
                </p>
                
                <h2>CPU</h2>
                <p>The CPU is in a sense the brain of the microcontroller. The CPU does the calculations 
                    and controls the “decisions” of the Arduino once our program was uploaded on to it. 
                    The CPU is a chip. In our case the chip’s name is Arduino Atmega.
                </p>
                <h2>Pins</h2>
                <p>The pins are places where we can connect our lights, motors, wires (our circuits too).
                     The CPU determines when these pins have a high or low output (wheter the light should 
                     be on or off); more on this later. 
                </p>
                <p>There are a variety of pins.</p>
                <p>Let us look at the Microcontroller. Pay attention to the number and symbols written on 
                    the floor, next to the pins.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing we should see is that they are all labeled differently. That is because
                     the labels next to them is the name given to them and we will refer to them by their 
                     names when we start programing them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second thing I want you to see is that some pins have a number, a name, and other 
                    symbols like ~ Tx and Rx. These pins can be used as regular pins but also have special
                     qualities to them that the others do not (more on this later). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third thing we should see are the GND, 5V, 3V pins. We use this pin to provide 
                    power to the Arduino via a battery when we want to use our robot and not have it
                     connected to the computer. The ground is also the negative side of the power, we 
                     need to connect at least one end of our circuit to this pin.
                </p>
                <h2>USB</h2>
                <p>The USB port is where we connect the microcontroller to our computer so that we can 
                    upload the compiled code onto the Arduino. (We write our code on our computer; our 
                    computer converts our code to 1’s and 0’s that then gets uploaded onto the controller).
                </p>
                <h2>Microcontroller</h2>
                <p>
                    The microcontroller is everything, the CPU, the Pins everything put together. In 
                    our case it is called the Arduino Uno R3.
                </p>

            <h2>First Arduino Program</h2>
            <p>Ideally, we all should have an Arduino Microcontroller, the components necessary and a 
                computer that you can use to code on. If you do not have one or more of these things, 
                that is fine (you can learn everything you need to learn even if you don’t have one). 
                Select the path that fits your needs.</p>
